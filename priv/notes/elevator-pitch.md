<div class="moved-to-livebooks">
  Since the release of <a target="blank" href="https://livebook.dev">livebook.dev</a>, I have been progressively moving my notes <a target="blank" href="https://github.com/marka2g/software-engineering-notes">here</a>. Recently, livebook.dev released the <a href="https://news.livebook.dev/deploy-notebooks-as-apps-quality-of-life-upgrades---launch-week-1---day-1-2OTEWI" target="blank">sections button</a> which is making me rethink how I organize my notes.

## The Quest for A Second Brain

If you're like me, one of your most sinister yet silent adversaries is, ...**`future` `self`**. Albeit pleasurable, spending a significant amount of time to level-up software engineering skills comes at a heavy cost - time. I've always struggled to centralize my software related notes in order to rinse and repeat a particular concept.

Like most of us, I desire to build a [second brain](https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com){:target="_blank" .under} with excellent back-linking capabilities. I love tools like [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md){:target="_blank" .under} and have recently discovered [Mem.ai](https://get.mem.ai){:target="_blank" .under}, however, these type of note taking apps either feel more like personal tools or lack the organizational &/or presentational features that I'm looking for. Even with plugins, feature gaps with these tools currently keep my software notes a bit too localized. This static site, with [livebook](https://github.com/elixir-nx/livebook) counterparts, is intended to materialize and prime my collection of learned insights for rapid fire recollection by **`future` `self`**.

>_**DISCLAIMER** - Feel free to use or copy at will. However, I do not claim any responsibility regarding the completeness of the examples contained as this app's purpose is solely for **self learning**. Often, you will see impartial explanations because the example has been cherry-picked to note an area or concept that requires highlighting. Use the code at your own risk; always test and check what you copy. Thanks!_
