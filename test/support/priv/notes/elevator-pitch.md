If you're like me, one of your most sinister yet silent adversaries is, ...**`future` `self`**. Albeit pleasurable, spending a significant amount of time on leveling up software engineering skills comes at a cost. I've always longed to effectively summarize and centralize the notes taken along the way. This app is intended to materialize and prime my collection of learned insights for rapid fire recollection by **`future` `self`**.


>_**DISCLAIMER** - Feel free to use or copy at will. However, I do not claim any responsibility regarding the completeness of the examples contained as this app's purpose is solely for **self learning**. Often, you will see impartial explanations because the example has been cherry-picked to note an area or concept that requires highlighting. Use the code at your own risk; always test and check what you copy. Thanks!_
